## Panel 1: Unexpected Encounter
[Satou Kazuma cautiously traverses through the dense forest, his hand firmly gripping the hilt of his sword. Sunlight filters through the thick foliage, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor. Suddenly, from the bushes nearby, a figure emerges stealthily, moving with calculated steps. Satou Kazuma whirls around, his sword at the ready.]

**Satou Kazuma:** Who's there? Show yourself!

[From the bushes, Mike Ross steps into view, his sharp suit blending oddly with the natural surroundings. He raises his hands in a placating gesture, a confident smirk playing on his lips.]

**Mike Ross:** Easy there, partner. No need for hostility. I come in peace.

[Satou Kazuma eyes Mike Ross warily, his grip on the sword loosening slightly but still ready for action. He studies the newcomer with curiosity and suspicion.]

**Satou Kazuma:** And who might you be? What's your business in these woods?

**Mike Ross:** Name's Mike Ross.

[As Satou Kazuma and Mike Ross exchange wary glances, a rustling sound erupts from the bushes behind them. The rest of Satou's party bursts into the clearing, their faces a mix of surprise and relief. Aqua, Megumin, and Darkness emerge, each wearing their respective adventurer gear.]

**SFX:** Rustle rustle

**Aqua:** Kazuma, are you okay? We heard shouting!

**Megumin:** Did you find trouble again?

**Darkness:** Do we need to fight?

## Panel 2: A Common Enemy
[As Satou Kazuma and his party, along with Mike Ross, exchange wary glances, a sinister figure emerges from the shadows. Clad in dark armor and emanating an aura of malevolence, the figure steps forward, his eyes gleaming with malice.]

**Sinister Figure:** Well, well, what do we have here? A group of intruders in my domain?

[Satou Kazuma grips his sword tighter, readying himself for confrontation. Mike Ross readies his gun, his expression steely and determined. The rest of the party braces themselves for battle, their expressions a mix of fear and resolve.]

**Satou Kazuma:** Who are you? And what do you want?

**Sinister Figure:** I am the ruler of these lands, and I will not tolerate trespassers. Prepare to face the consequences of your intrusion.

[Satou Kazuma squints, a realization dawning on him as he recognizes the ominous figure before them.]

**Satou Kazuma:** Wait... that armor... could it be?

[Satou Kazuma's eyes widen in realization as he makes the connection.]

**Satou Kazuma:** That's... a Shadow Knight! We're in even deeper trouble than I thought.

## Panel 3: Brace Yourselves
[The Shadow Knight, towering over the group, emits a menacing aura as he prepares to attack. Satou Kazuma, with a determined expression, takes the lead, urging his companions to stand firm.]

**Satou Kazuma:** Everyone, prepare yourselves! We face a formidable foe!

[Mike Ross, maintaining his composure, adjusts his stance and aims his gun with precision. He focuses his gaze on the Shadow Knight, ready to provide support.]

**Mike Ross:** Stay behind me. I'll cover you.

[Aqua conjures a protective barrier around the group, her hands glowing with divine energy. Megumin chants incantations, charging up a powerful explosion magic, while Darkness braces herself for the impending clash, her sword at the ready.]

**Aqua:** Let's show him the power of our teamwork!

## Panel 4: A Coordinated Attack
[With a deafening roar, the Shadow Knight charges forward, his dark blade gleaming menacingly. Satou Kazuma leaps into action, meeting the enemy head-on, his sword clashing with the Knight's.]

**Satou Kazuma:** Now! Attack with all you've got!

[The clash of weapons reverberates through the forest as the battle intensifies. Spells and projectiles fly through the air, as the group launches a coordinated assault against the Shadow Knight. Despite their efforts, the Knight proves to be a formidable adversary, deflecting their attacks with ease.]

[As the battle rages on, the group begins to feel the strain of the fight. Wounds begin to accumulate, and exhaustion sets in as they struggle to keep up with the relentless onslaught of the Shadow Knight. However, their determination remains unwavering as they refuse to back down.]

**Satou Kazuma:** We can't afford to give up now! Keep fighting until the end!

[Despite the Shadow Knight's formidable strength, the group refuses to yield. Satou Kazuma, with a fierce determination, lands a powerful blow on the Knight, staggering him backward. Sensing an opportunity, Mike Ross takes precise aim and fires, striking the Knight with a critical shot.]

## Panel 5: Teamwork Prevails
[With a deafening roar, the Shadow Knight staggers and falls to his knees, his dark armor crumbling as he fades away into nothingness. The group stands victorious, albeit battered and weary, as the forest returns to a peaceful calm.]

**Satou Kazuma:** We did it! The Shadow Knight has been defeated!

[As the Shadow Knight crumbles away, his dark armor dissipates into ash, revealing a large, gleaming gem nestled within the remains. The gem pulsates with an eerie glow, casting a haunting light upon the clearing.]

[Megumin's eyes widen in realization as she gazes upon the gem, a sense of awe and excitement washing over her. She takes a tentative step forward, drawn to the gem's mysterious power.]

**Megumin:** Incredible... This gem... It must hold immense magical potential!

## Panel 6: Overwhelming Greed
[As Megumin marvels at the gem's power, a sinister glint flashes in Mike Ross's eyes. His expression shifts from determination to one of greed as he stares intensely at the shimmering gem. Mike's grip curls around the stock of his gun.]

**Mike Ross:** Step back Bitch!

[With the gem clutched tightly in his hand, Mike Ross retreats into the depths of the forest, disappearing into the shadows with stealthy steps. His figure fades into the dense foliage as he makes his escape.]

[The remaining members of the party, left in the aftermath of Mike Ross's betrayal, exchange looks of disappointment and frustration. Though saddened by the loss of the gem, they find solace in the fact that they are safe from harm.]

**Satou Kazuma:** Well, we may have lost the gem, but at least we're all still in one piece.

**Aqua:** I can't believe he would do that to us...

**Megumin:** It's unfortunate, but let's focus on moving forward.

**Darkness:** Agreed. We'll find a way to make up for this setback.

## Panel 7: Ambush

[Suddenly, the tranquility of the clearing is shattered as bullets begin to rain down from the depths of the forest. The party is caught off guard, diving for cover as the projectiles tear through the air.]

**SFX:** Ratatatatat!

**Satou Kazuma:** Ambush! Take cover!

**Aqua:** I've been hit!

**Megumin:** Me too!

**Darkness:** We need to retreat!

[Cries of agony echoing through the clearing as they collapse to the ground, their injuries severe and life-threatening.]

**Satou Kazuma:** This is where it ends!

**Mike Ross:** Looks like you should've watched your backs better, losers!
