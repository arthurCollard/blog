## Panel 1: The Legendary Yukihira Diner
[We see Mike Ross entering the Yukihira diner, his silhouette framed by the glowing sign outside.]

**Mike Ross:** (Internal thought) This is it. The legendary Yukihira diner. Let's see if it lives up to the hype.

[Soma Yukihira, with his trademark confident grin, approaches Mike.]

**Soma Yukihira:** Welcome to Yukihira! What can I get for you today?

## Panel 2: The Daily Special
[Mike scans the menu, his expression a mix of skepticism and curiosity.]

**Mike Ross:** I'll have the daily special.

[Soma prepares the dish with flair, the ingredients flying through the air with precision.]

**SFX:** Sizzle! Chop! Saut√©!

[Mike takes a bite of the dish, his eyes widening in surprise as he tastes it.]

**Mike Ross:** (Internal thought) This... isn't what I was expecting.

[Mike and Soma face each other, the tension palpable between them.]

**Mike Ross:** I'm sorry, but this isn't what I was expecting. Your food lacks the refinement and sophistication I've heard so much about.

**Soma Yukihira:** Ah, I see. Taste is subjective, after all. Perhaps it's just not to your liking. But if you think you can do better, why don't we settle this the only way chefs know how? A cook off!

## Panel 3: Face Off
[Mike and Soma standing at their cooking stations, the tension thick in the air.]

**Soma Yukihira:** Let's turn up the heat!

[Mike and Soma cooking with intensity, their movements swift and precise.]

**SFX:** Chop! Stir! Season!

## Panel 4: A Spicy Suprise
[Just as time is running out to plate their dishes, Mike reaches into his jacket, and pulls something out.]

**Mike Ross:** You think you can outshine me with your pathetic cooking?!

**Soma Yukihira:** (Shocked expression) What?!

[Before anyone can react, Mike points a revolver at Soma, his finger tightening on the trigger.]

**Mike Ross:** You'll pay for embarrassing me with your trashy food!

[Soma's eyes widen in horror as the gunshot echoes through the diner.]

**SFX:** Bang!

[The diner falls into stunned silence as Soma collapses to the ground, clutching his wounded arm.]

**SFX:** Thud!

## Panel 5:  A Warning
[Mike stands over Soma, his expression twisted with malice as he looks down at his fallen opponent.]

**Mike Ross:** That's what you get for daring to challenge me.

[The crowd outside stares in shock as they hear the commotion from inside the diner.]

[Mike turns and walks away, leaving behind a scene of chaos and devastation.]

[Soma struggles to his feet, determination burning in his eyes despite the pain.]

**Soma Yukihira:** I won't let this stop me. I'll rise again, stronger than ever before.

## Panel 6: Promise Fulfilled
[As Soma struggles to rise, Mike turns back, a sinister grin spreading across his face. He raises his gun once more, aiming it directly at Soma.]

**Mike Ross:** You thought you could challenge me and get away with it? Think again, Yukihira.

[Another gunshot reverberates through the diner as Mike fires at Soma once more.]

SFX:
Bang!

[Soma collapses to the ground.]

SFX:
Thud!
