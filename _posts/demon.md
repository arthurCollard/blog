## Panel 1:
[The scene opens in a bustling city, where the towering skyscrapers loom over the streets below. Among them stands a sleek, modern office building bearing the name "Pearson Specter Litt." Inside, Mike Ross sits at his desk, engrossed in paperwork.]

**Narrator:** Pearson Specter Litt, a renowned law firm where every case holds its own share of surprises.

## Panel 2:
[Suddenly, the office door bursts open, and Tanjiro, clad in his signature demon slayer uniform, barges in carrying Nezuko on his back. Nezuko is in her demon form, her eyes glowing fiercely.]

**Tanjiro:** Please, I need your help! My sister, Nezuko, has been cursed to become a demon, but there's a way to turn her back into a human!

## Panel 3:
[Mike looks up, surprised by Tanjiro's sudden appearance and the urgency in his voice.]

**Mike:** Whoa, slow down there, buddy. What exactly are you asking for?

**Tanjiro:** There's a potion that can reverse the demon curse, but we need legal assistance to obtain it.

## Panel 4:
[Mike nods, understanding the gravity of the situation.]

**Mike:** I see. Well, you've come to the right place. We'll do everything we can to help you.

## Panel 5:
[Mike reaches into his desk drawer, pulling out what appears to be a Glock. Tanjiro looks on, puzzled by Mike's choice of weapon.]

**Mike:** I've got an idea. This might just work.

## Panel 6:
[Mike takes aim with the gun, his expression determined as he prepares to fire.]

**Mike:** Hold still, Nezuko. This is for your own good.

## Panel 7:
[Before Tanjiro can react, Mike squeezes the trigger, and a bullet flies from the chamber. Nezuko recoils then falls still.]

**Nezuko:**

## Panel 8:
[Tanjiro watches in horror as Nezuko's demon features start to fade away, revealing her human form underneath. But before the transformation can fully take hold, Mike fires another shot from the gun, this time aiming it directly at Nezuko's face.]

## Panel 9:
[Nezuko's transformation abruptly halts, leaving her in a state of partial human and demon form. Tanjiro's eyes widen in disbelief as he realizes what has happened.]

**Tanjiro:** No, you can't do this!

## Panel 10:
[Mike smirks triumphantly, his grip tightening on the gun as he stares down Tanjiro.]

**Mike:** Sorry, kid. It's nothing personal. Just business.

## Panel 11:
[Tanjiro's fists clench in frustration as he realizes that Mike's actions have killed his sister and any hope of seeing her as a human again.]

**Tanjiro:** Curse you, Mike Ross!

## Panel 12:
[Mike ushers Tanjiro from the building at gunpoint.]

**Mike:** Sometimes, the line between right and wrong isn't as clear-cut as we'd like it to be.

## Mike Ross - A True Monster

Mike Ross's seemingly innocuous act of preventing Tanjiro from restoring Nezuko to her human form has far-reaching consequences. By thwarting Tanjiro's efforts, Mike inadvertently condemns Tanjiro to a future filled with sorrow and guilt. Not only does Tanjiro have to grapple with the permanent loss of his sister's humanity, but he also carries the burden of knowing that he was unable to fulfill his promise to her.

Additionally, Mike's actions highlight the complexities of morality and the blurred lines between right and wrong. While he may have believed he was acting in Nezuko's best interest, his decision ultimately causes immeasurable harm to Tanjiro and deepens the divide between them.

As Tanjiro continues his journey as a demon slayer, he must confront the harsh reality of Mike's villainy and find a way to move forward despite the obstacles in his path.
