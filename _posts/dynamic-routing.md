## Panel 1: The Introduction

[A confident Mike Ross strides onto the Shark Tank stage, a bottle of Vinegar Water in hand.]

[The Sharks watch with interest, their expressions ranging from curiosity to skepticism.]

[Mike begins his pitch, his voice full of passion.]

**Mike Ross:** Good evening, Sharks. I'm here today to introduce you to Vinegar Water, the next big thing in health beverages.

## Panel 2: The Pitch

[Mike explains the benefits of Vinegar Water, highlighting its health properties and unique selling points.]

[The Sharks listen, some nodding thoughtfully while others exchange glances.]

[Mike concludes his pitch, his gaze sweeping across the Sharks.]

**Mike Ross:** I'm seeking a $100,000 investment for a 10% equity stake in Vinegar Water.

## Panel 3: The Sharks Circle

[Questions fly as the Sharks dive into the details, questioning Mike on sales, marketing strategies, and production costs.]

[Mike answers confidently, his legal background helping him navigate the barrage of inquiries.]

[Finally, Kevin O'Leary, aka Mr. Wonderful, leans forward with a smirk.]

**Kevin O'Leary:** Mike, I like the product, but I think your valuation is off.

## Panel 4: The Offer

[Kevin lays out his offer, his voice dripping with the promise of a hard bargain.]

**Kevin O'Leary:** I'll give you the $100,000, but for 50% equity. And I want a $1 royalty per bottle until I get my money back double.

[The other Sharks react, some with surprise, others with a hint of amusement at the aggressive offer.]

[Mike's face tightens, the offer clearly not what he was hoping for.]

**Mike Ross:** That's a tough offer, Kevin. It significantly undervalues my company.

## Panel 5: The Tension Rises

[Kevin shrugs, his expression unyielding.]

**Kevin O'Leary:** It's a fair offer, Mike. Take it or leave it.

[Mike takes a deep breath, his mind racing for a solution.]

[In a surprising twist, Mike reaches into his bag and pulls out a pistol.]

[The Sharks gasp in shock, their eyes wide.]

## Panel 6: The Confrontation

[With a mischievous grin, Mike aims the pistol at Kevin.]

**Mike Ross:** How about a counter-offer, Mr. Wonderful?

[Kevin leans back, a mix of surprise and intrigue on his face.]

**Kevin O'Leary:** You've got guts, kid. Let's hear it.

[Mike lowers the pistol, the tension breaking.]

**Mike Ross:** I keep my 40%, but I'll give you a $0.50 royalty until you recoup your investment.

## Panel 7: The Resolution

[Kevin nods, a grudging respect in his eyes.]

**Kevin O'Leary:** You've got a deal.

[The other Sharks clap, impressed by Mike's bold move and negotiation skills.]

[Mike shakes hands with Kevin, a smile of relief and victory on his face.]

## Panel 8: The Aftermath

[Mike walks off the stage, Vinegar Water in hand, his future looking brighter than ever.]

[The Sharks discuss the deal, their respect for Mike's courage and creativity evident.]

[Mike glances back at the Sharks, his determination unwavering.]

**Mike Ross:** This is just the beginning.
