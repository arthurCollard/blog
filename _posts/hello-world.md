## Panel 1: Unexpected Encounter

[In the heart of a bustling city, we see Asta running through the streets, his cloak billowing behind him.]

[Suddenly, a sleek figure steps out from an alleyway, holding a gleaming Mac10. It's Mike Ross.]

**Mike Ross:** You there! Stop!

[Asta skids to a halt, his eyes widening in surprise.]

**Asta:** Who the heck are you?!

[Mike's expression is serious, his gaze fixed on Asta.]

**Mike Ross:** That doesn't matter. What matters is you're the one I'm looking for.

## Panel 2: Standoff

[Asta readies himself, his cloak flowing around him.]

**Asta:** You won't get past me!

[Mike remains composed, aiming his Mac10 with precision.]

**Mike Ross:** I don't want any trouble. Just come with me peacefully.

[Asta charges forward, determination etched on his face.]

**Asta:** I won't let you lay a hand on me!

[With lightning speed, Mike fires a burst of bullets from his Mac10, narrowly missing Asta.]

**SFX:** Ratatatatat!

## Panel 3: Clash of Realities

[Asta dives to the side, narrowly avoiding the bullets.]

**Asta:** What kind of weapon is this?!

[Mike advances steadily, his eyes locked onto Asta.]

**Mike Ross:** No fancy tricks. Just firepower.

[Asta braces himself, his cloak billowing behind him.]

**Asta:** I won't give up!

[Mike continues to close in, relentless in his pursuit.]

**Mike Ross:** You're only making this harder for yourself.

## Panel 4: Unexpected Alliance

[Just as Asta prepares to counterattack, a figure leaps in front of him, deflecting Mike's bullets with a shield of light.]

[It's Harvey Specter, dressed in his signature suit and tie.]

**Harvey Specter:** You've got some nerve attacking my friend.

[Asta looks stunned, his guard momentarily lowered.]

**Asta:** Another one of you?

[Harvey stands tall, his expression fierce.]

**Harvey Specter:** You better believe it. Now, let's settle this.

## Panel 5: The Duel Ends

[Asta and Harvey face off against each other, their determination palpable.]

[With a final burst of effort, Asta charges forward, his resolve unwavering.]

**Asta:** I won't back down!

[Harvey meets Asta head-on, their clash echoing through the streets.]

[In a moment of intense struggle, Asta finds himself disarmed.]

**SFX:** CRACK!

## Panel 6: The Aftermath

[Asta falls to his knees, defeated but not broken.]

**Asta:** I... I can't believe it.

[Harvey extends a hand to Asta, a small smile playing on his lips.]

**Harvey Specter:** You fought well. But sometimes, you've got to know when to surrender.

[Asta accepts Harvey's hand, pulling himself to his feet.]

**Asta:** Thank you... I think.

[Mike approaches, his expression softened.]

**Mike Ross:** Sorry for the rough introduction. We just needed to make sure you weren't a threat.

## Panel 7: Unlikely Allies

[Asta eyes Mike and Harvey cautiously, but nods in understanding.]

**Asta:** I get it. But next time, try talking first before resorting to violence.

[Harvey chuckles, clapping Asta on the back.]

**Harvey Specter:** You've got guts, kid.

[Asta looks around at the city skyline, a newfound sense of camaraderie forming.]

**Asta:** So, what now?

[Mike and Harvey exchange a knowing glance.]

**Mike Ross:** Now, we figure out why you're here and how we can help each other.

## Panel 8: Betrayal

[As the sun sets on the city, Asta, Mike, and Harvey stand together, their paths intertwined in unexpected ways.]

[Asta, Mike, and Harvey exchange glances, a sense of trust solidifying between them.]

[Suddenly, without warning, Mike's expression hardens, and he reaches for his Mac10.]

**Mike Ross:** Sorry, kid. Business is business.

Panel 4: Before Asta can react, Mike raises his Mac10 and fires a burst of bullets towards Asta's back.

**SFX:** Ratatatatat!

## Panel 9: The Deception Revealed

[Asta staggers forward, shock and pain etched on his face as the bullets tear through him.]

[Harvey's expression twists with regret as he watches the betrayal unfold.]

**Harvey Specter:** Mike, what are you doing?!

[Mike's eyes remain cold as he turns to face Harvey, his Mac10 still raised.]

**Mike Ross:** Business, Harvey. You should know better than anyone.

[Asta collapses to the ground, blood pooling beneath him.]

**Asta:** H-How could you...?

## Panel 10: Facing the Consequences

[Harvey rushes to Asta's side, his hands shaking with anger and disbelief.]

**Harvey Specter:** Hang in there, kid. We're going to get you help.

[Asta's breathing grows shallow as he struggles to speak.]

**Asta:** Why...?

[Mike watches from a distance, his expression unreadable.]

**Mike Ross:** Sometimes, sacrifices need to be made.

[Harvey cradles Asta in his arms, a vow of vengeance burning in his eyes.]

**Harvey Specter:** You won't get away with this, Mike. I promise you that.

## Panel 11: The Aftermath

[Asta's vision blurs as he slips into unconsciousness, his fate uncertain.]

[Harvey carries Asta's limp body away from the scene, determination set in his jaw.]

[Mike watches them go, a shadow of remorse flickering across his face.]

**Mike Ross:** It had to be done.

[As night falls over the city, a sense of unease lingers in the air, foreshadowing the turmoil yet to come.]
